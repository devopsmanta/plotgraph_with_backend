                    The Basics: It has never been that easy to plot graphs online. Just press edit and a prompt for
                    entering
                    the expression you want to plot will appear. Enter your function and press plot. Here you go! The
                    plot
                    of your graph shows up immediately. To plot an additional graph press + and then repeat the steps
                    from
                    above. The new graph will be added to your existing plot. If you want to remove a graph from your
                    plot
                    just press - to delete it. Each new graph will be drawn in a new color. The colors are chosen
                    automatically at the moment. In future we will allow you also to set a specific style for each of
                    your
                    particular plots.
